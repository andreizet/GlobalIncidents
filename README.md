The api will return data representing incidents from all over the word. 

In ```mobile_app``` & ```web_app``` you will find a two simple applications, one for Android and a web one, made with NodeJs. The appswill get some incidents from one of the APIs, then draws them in form of a marker on a map. The web application also displays a chart with incidents grouped by category.
